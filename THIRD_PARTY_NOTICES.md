# Third-party notices

The project license (AGPL-3.0-only from commit 3edf859 and v1.10.0; MIT for
v1.9.2 and earlier, see LICENSE_HISTORY.md) covers original project
material only. The following bundled third-party files retain their
upstream notices and licenses.

| Bundled file | Version | Upstream | License text |
|---|---|---|---|
| `web/vendor/marked.min.js` | 12.0.2 | https://github.com/markedjs/marked/tree/v12.0.2 | [Marked and Markdown notices](licenses/marked-LICENSE.md) |
| `web/vendor/purify.min.js` | DOMPurify 3.1.6 | https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify/tree/3.1.6 | [Apache-2.0 OR MPL-2.0](licenses/DOMPurify-LICENSE.txt) |
| `web/vendor/katex/` (`katex.min.js`, `katex.min.css`, `fonts/*.woff2`) | KaTeX 0.16.22 | https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX/tree/v0.16.22 | [MIT](licenses/KaTeX-LICENSE.txt) |
| `web/vendor/codemirror/codemirror.min.js` | CodeMirror 6 (`@codemirror/view` 6.43.15, `@codemirror/state` 6.7.6 and the language, search, command and theme packages listed in `licenses/codemirror/PACKAGES.txt`; Lezer parsers; `crelt`, `style-mod`, `w3c-keyname`, `@marijn/find-cluster-break`) | https://codemirror.net/ , https://github.com/codemirror , https://github.com/lezer-parser | [MIT, one license file per package](licenses/codemirror/PACKAGES.txt) |
| `web/vendor/xterm/` (`xterm.js`, `xterm.css`, `addon-fit.js`) | xterm.js 6.0.0 (`@xterm/xterm`), fit addon 0.11.0 (`@xterm/addon-fit`) | https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js | [MIT](licenses/xterm-LICENSE.txt), [MIT](licenses/xterm-addon-fit-LICENSE.txt) |
| `web/vendor/pdfjs/` (`pdf.min.js`, `pdf.worker.min.js`, `cmaps/`, `standard_fonts/`, `wasm/`) | PDF.js 6.4.299 (`pdfjs-dist`) | https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/v6.4.299 | [Apache-2.0](licenses/pdf.js-LICENSE.txt); bundled fonts and decoders keep the license files next to them (`standard_fonts/LICENSE_FOXIT`, `LICENSE_LIBERATION`, `wasm/LICENSE_*`) |

Marked and DOMPurify are bundled unchanged from the imported v1.1.0 source.
KaTeX files are copied unchanged from the `katex@0.16.22` npm package
(`dist/`); only the WOFF2 fonts are included, which the stylesheet lists first. Original
copyright and license headers remain intact. Marked's upstream license file
also includes the Markdown redistribution notice. DOMPurify's upstream
license file includes both offered license texts.
PDF.js files are copied unchanged from the `pdfjs-dist@6.4.299` npm package
(`legacy/build/`, `cmaps/`, `standard_fonts/`, `wasm/`; the QuickJS files used only by the
PDF scripting sandbox are left out because the app never runs PDF scripts); the two ES module
builds are renamed from `.mjs` to `.js` so every platform's local file server
serves them as JavaScript. Source maps are not included.

xterm.js files (1.18, Code terminal) are copied unchanged from the `@xterm/xterm@6.0.0` (`lib/xterm.js`, `css/xterm.css`)
and `@xterm/addon-fit@0.11.0` (`lib/addon-fit.js`) npm packages; source maps are not included.

The CodeMirror bundle is built from the unmodified npm packages pinned in
`tools/codemirror/package.json` (and `package-lock.json`) by `tools/codemirror/build.mjs`
(esbuild, minified IIFE exposing `window.CM`); the only project code in it is
`tools/codemirror/entry.js` (AGPL-3.0-only). The build copies every bundled package's
LICENSE file into `licenses/codemirror/`. Verilog/SystemVerilog, Tcl and Shell highlighting
use the CodeMirror 5 legacy modes from `@codemirror/legacy-modes`.

Plugins installed from the Plugins screen (1.12) are downloaded at the
user's request from https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins
(Apache-2.0) and are not bundled with the app. Each installed plugin keeps
its own LICENSE file in the user's data folder (`plugins/<name>/`).

Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` and build dependencies are
installed separately and retain their respective licenses. When distributing
a built installer, include the applicable dependency license notices with it.
The installer bundles these runtime packages (and their dependencies) for
document reading and the built-in Office MCP servers:

The desktop builds copy the license and notice files that each bundled
Python package ships into `licenses/python/<package>-<version>/` inside the
app. The app shows all of them under Settings → Third-party licenses.

paramiko is used unmodified, as published on PyPI. Because POSCHAT itself is
free software (AGPL-3.0-only) with its complete source and build scripts
(`build_installer.py`) published, you can rebuild the app against a modified
or newer paramiko, as the LGPL allows.

The Android app bundles the Chaquopy runtime (MIT) with CPython 3.11
(PSF-2.0), the Android builds of the Python packages above from the Chaquopy
package repository (including numpy, BSD-3-Clause, and cryptography 42.0.8),
AndroidX core/activity/webkit and the Kotlin standard library (Apache-2.0),
and the
`libsherpa-onnx-c-api.so` and `libonnxruntime.so` libraries taken unchanged
from the official sherpa-onnx 1.13.8 Android package
(https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/v1.13.8; sherpa-onnx:
Apache-2.0, ONNX Runtime: MIT).

HWP reading follows the publicly released Hancom HWP 5.0 file format
specification; this project is not affiliated with Hancom.

The built-in `paper`, `notion` and `firecrawl` MCP servers bundle no
third-party code. At run time they call public services under those
services' own terms: the arXiv API, the Semantic Scholar API (Allen
Institute for AI), the Notion API and the Firecrawl API. The recommended
`playwright` server downloads and runs Microsoft Playwright MCP
(https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp, Apache-2.0) with `npx` on the
user's PC only when the user turns it on; it is not included in the
installer. This project is not affiliated with arXiv, the Allen Institute
for AI, Notion, Firecrawl or Microsoft.

PO노트 speech models are not included in the installer. The app downloads
them from Hugging Face, pinned by commit and checked by SHA-256: the small
voice-activity model on the first recording, and a recognition model only
when the user downloads it for local speech recognition. They remain under
their publishers' terms: the Silero VAD model
(https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/vad), the k2-fsa Korean Zipformer model
(https://huggingface.co/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx-zipformer-korean-2024-06-24) and
the SenseVoice Small model converted for sherpa-onnx
(https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-sense-voice-zh-en-ja-ko-yue-2024-07-17).
Silero VAD is MIT-licensed and the Korean Zipformer model is Apache-2.0 (converted
from johnBamma/icefall-asr-ksponspeech-zipformer-2024-06-24). SenseVoice Small is
distributed by Alibaba under the FunASR Model Open Source License Agreement 1.1
(https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR/blob/main/MODEL_LICENSE), which requires keeping
the source, author and model name; it is not a free-software license and the model is
never bundled with POSCHAT.

Version 1.10 connectors call the GitHub, Google Workspace, Zotero, Semantic
Scholar, arXiv and (when the user configures them) Qdrant, embedding and
Langfuse services at run time under those services' own terms. No code from
those services is bundled.
